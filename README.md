# HeartRateToWeb

## Introduction

This program let you use the heart sensor of your Samsung Watch to display it on software that can read file like OBS. (tutorial below + watch compatibility list below). 

This is a simple python program that react like a mini web server without the need of installing software like WAMP / LAMP or other web server like Apache / Nginix.

## How does it work ?

When you launch the file, the web server will start on your localhost and your LAN IP.

Usually for the best reaction time, you will use the LAN IP on your watch, and the localhost address on your software.

To maximise the compatibility between devices, I started the project on a web app. This is fast and a convinient way to put things in place.

## Bugs ? How do I report one ?

For now, none. If you found one, please use the issue section.
